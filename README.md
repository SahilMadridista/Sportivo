Sportivo is an Android application that is developed on Android Studio using Java, XML, Firebase and different libraries. 
This application is developed for the sportspersons that are not much aware of the sports events happening near them.

------------------------------------------------------

Steps to use Sportivo-

1) The user have to create an account first. He/She can create an account using his/her email.

2) When the account gets created, the user get logged in the application.

3) The app gives user the options to select the sports in which he/she wants to get notified.

4) After the 3rd step, the user gets to the home page where he/she can see the events happening around him/her if there is any event uploaded
by the admin application.

5) The user can register for the event he/she likes.

These were the steps to use the application.

What to implement in the application next-

I was thinking to implement more in this application.

1) First thing is to give an app to the sports organizations so that they can upload their events.

2) The organizations can manage the events by themself.
